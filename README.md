# BoardgameListingWebApp

## Description

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.  

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2
- Thymeleaf
- Thymeleaf Fragments
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Spring MVC
- JDBC
- H2 Database Engine (In-memory)
- JUnit test framework
- Spring Security
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Maven

## Features

- Full-Stack Application
- UI components created with Thymeleaf and styled with Twitter Bootstrap
- Authentication and authorization using Spring Security
  - Authentication by allowing the users to authenticate with a username and password
  - Authorization by granting different permissions based on the roles (non-members, users, and managers)
- Different roles (non-members, users, and managers) with varying levels of permissions
  - Non-members only can see the boardgame lists and reviews
  - Users can add board games and write reviews
  - Managers can edit and delete the reviews
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2
- JUnit test framework for unit testing
- Spring MVC best practices to segregate views, controllers, and database packages
- JDBC for database connectivity and interaction
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data in the database
- Schema.sql file to customize the schema and input initial data
- Thymeleaf Fragments to reduce redundancy of repeating HTML elements (head, footer, navigation)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your IDE of choice
3. Run the application
4. To use initial user data, use the following credentials.
  - username: bugs    |     password: bunny (user role)
  - username: daffy   |     password: duck  (manager role)
5. You can also sign-up as a new user and customize your role to play with the application! 😊

#### Steps

To create an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/console/.
   - Sign in with your AWS account credentials.

2. **Navigate to EC2**:
   - Once logged in, navigate to the EC2 dashboard by typing "EC2" in the search bar at the top or by selecting "Services" and then "EC2" under the "Compute" section.

3. **Launch Instance**:
   - Click on the "Instances" link in the EC2 dashboard sidebar.
   - Click the "Launch Instance" button.

4. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**:
   - In the "Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)" section, select "Ubuntu" from the list of available AMIs.
   - Choose the Ubuntu version you want to use. For example, "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS".
   - Click "Select".

5. **Choose an Instance Type**:
   - In the "Step 2: Choose an Instance Type" section, select the instance type that fits your requirements. The default option (usually a t2.micro instance) is suitable for testing and small workloads.
   - Click "Next: Configure Instance Details".

6. **Configure Instance Details**:
   - Optionally, configure instance details such as network settings, subnets, IAM role, etc. You can leave these settings as default for now.
   - Click "Next: Add Storage".

7. **Add Storage**:
   - Specify the size of the root volume (default is usually fine for testing purposes).
   - Click "Next: Add Tags".

8. **Add Tags**:
   - Optionally, add tags to your instance for better organization and management.
   - Click "Next: Configure Security Group".

9. **Configure Security Group**:
   - In the "Step 6: Configure Security Group" section, configure the security group to allow SSH access (port 22) from your IP address.
   - You may also want to allow other ports based on your requirements (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) as in this pic ![Alt text](https://github.com/jaiswaladi246/DevOps_Shack_Ultimate_Pipeline_12_march/blob/main/PHASE-1/Screenshot%202024-03-13%20002123.png)
   - Click "Review and Launch".

10. **Review and Launch**:
    - Review the configuration of your instance.
    - Click "Launch".

11. **Select Key Pair**:
    - In the pop-up window, select an existing key pair or create a new one.
    - Check the acknowledgment box.
    - Click "Launch Instances".

12. **Access Your Instance**:
    - Use Mobaxterm

To summarize, perform the following steps on each node in your cluster:

vi /etc/sysctl.conf

-Add or update the following line:

net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

- Save and exit the editor.

Apply the changes with

sysctl -p

# get worker node commands to run to join additional nodes into cluster
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
